## Welcome to OptoEd

###### The software is developde by [Maggie Zhang](https://github.com/MaggieZhang17). The individual research project is supervised by Dr. Edmund Harbord.

OptoEd is an educational tool to aid teaching of unit: EENG30004 Optoelectronic Devices and Systems at the Universiy of Bristol. OptoEd is a programme developed on Matlab GUI.

The graphical interface of OptoEd allows to show active optoelectronics behaviours through plotting graphs. The purpose of OptoEd is to provide a tool to help students comprehend optoelectronic knowledge from user-interaction and visualization. 

OptoEd is fully implemented in the Matlab software environment of MathWorks under Windows operating system. GUIDE (Graphical User Interface Development Environment) was used to create a friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). The application was developed to serve student users who enrolled the EENG30004 unit for educational purposes, although anyone who has interests in active optoelctronic devices are welcomed. 

A detailed description of the OptoEd program can be found in the thesis: OptoEd - Pedagogical MATLAB Graphical User Interface (GUI) Program for EENG30004 Optoelectronic Devices and Systems.
